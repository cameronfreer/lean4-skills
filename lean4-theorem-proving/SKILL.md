# Lean 4 Theorem Proving

## Overview

Lean 4 is an interactive theorem prover. Unlike traditional code, correctness is verified by the type checker‚Äîthere are no "unit tests." Success means eliminating all `sorry`s and building with clean proofs that use only standard axioms.

**Core principle:** Build incrementally, structure before solving, and trust the type checker.

## Powerful Tools at Your Disposal

**üöÄ FIRST: Check if the Lean MCP server is available** (for Claude Code users)

The Lean MCP server provides the most powerful workflow:
- `mcp__lean-lsp__lean_goal` - See proof state at any location (VERY USEFUL!)
- `mcp__lean-lsp__lean_diagnostic_messages` - Get all errors/warnings
- `mcp__lean-lsp__lean_leansearch` - Semantic theorem search
- `mcp__lean-lsp__lean_loogle` - Type-based search
- `mcp__lean-lsp__lean_local_search` - Search current workspace
- And many more (see `references/mcp-server.md` for full details)

**If MCP server available:** Use it as your primary interface. It's faster and more integrated than scripts.

**If MCP server NOT available:** Use the automation scripts below.

### Automation Scripts (8 Production-Ready Tools)

Located in `scripts/` directory - all scripts designed for efficient subagent delegation:

**Search & Discovery:**
- `search_mathlib.sh` - Find lemmas/theorems by name or pattern
- `smart_search.sh` - Multi-source search (LeanSearch + Loogle APIs + local)
- `find_instances.sh` - Discover type class instances and patterns

**Analysis & Metrics:**
- `proof_complexity.sh` - Analyze proof length, identify refactoring targets
- `dependency_graph.sh` - Visualize theorem dependencies (DOT/text)

**Verification & Tracking:**
- `check_axioms_inline.sh` - Verify axiom usage (works with namespaces) ‚úÖ Recommended
- `sorry_analyzer.py` - Extract sorries with context, interactive mode available

**‚ö° Subagent Delegation Pattern (Claude Code users):**

Instead of running scripts directly, dispatch lightweight Explore agents:
```
"Dispatch Explore agent to run scripts/smart_search.sh 'continuous compact' and report top 3 results"
```

**Benefits:** 6x token reduction, cleaner conversation, parallel execution. See "Leveraging Subagents for Automation" section below for full patterns.

**For users without Claude Code:** Run scripts directly from command line.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill applies to ANY Lean 4 development across all mathematical domains:
- Pure mathematics (algebra, topology, analysis, number theory, combinatorics)
- Applied mathematics (probability, optimization, numerical methods)
- Computer science (algorithms, data structures, program verification)
- Contributing to or extending mathlib

**Especially important when you see:**
- **Compilation errors:** "failed to synthesize instance", "maximum recursion depth", "type mismatch", "unknown identifier"
- **Type class issues:** MeasurableSpace, IsProbabilityMeasure, or other instance synthesis failures
- **Sorry accumulation:** Multiple sorries with unclear elimination strategy
- **Axiom proliferation:** Custom axioms without documented proof plans
- **Search challenges:** Need to find mathlib lemmas but don't know where to look
- **Working with:** measure theory, conditional expectation, œÉ-algebras, integrability

## The Build-First Principle

```
ALWAYS ensure the file compiles before committing
```

**Lean has no runtime tests.** The type checker IS your test suite.

**Build commands:**
```bash
lake build              # Full project
lake env lean MyFile.lean  # Single file
lake clean && lake build   # Clean rebuild
```

**Before any commit:**
1. Run `lake build` on the full project
2. Verify no new errors introduced
3. Document any remaining `sorry`s with clear strategy

## The 4-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Structure Before Solving

**DON'T:** Start writing tactics immediately
**DO:** Understand the goal structure first

```lean
-- ‚úÖ Good: Structure with clear subgoals
lemma main_theorem (h : Hypothesis) : Conclusion := by
  -- Strategy: Show Q by constructing witness from h
  -- Need: (1) Extract x from h, (2) Show x satisfies Q
  have h_extract : Extract := sorry  -- TODO: Use helper_lemma_1
  have h_property : Property := sorry  -- TODO: Apply known_result
  sorry  -- TODO: Combine above
```

**Key insight:** Outline proof strategy before writing tactics. Break into named helpers, use `have` for subgoals, document sorries.

### Phase 2: Helper Lemmas First

Build infrastructure bottom-up. Extract reusable components:

```lean
private lemma helper_step (x : X) : Property x := sorry

theorem main : Result := by
  have h1 := helper_step x
  have h2 := helper_step y
  -- Combine h1 and h2
```

### Phase 3: Incremental Filling

**One sorry at a time:** Choose ONE sorry ‚Üí Fill completely ‚Üí Compile ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Repeat

**Never:** Fill 5 sorries simultaneously, commit without compiling, or skip documentation.

**üöÄ Track sorries with MCP server (if available):**
```lean
-- See proof state at sorry location
mcp__lean-lsp__lean_goal("MyFile.lean", line_number, column_number)
```

**‚ö° Use interactive navigator (Claude Code users):**
```bash
scripts/sorry_analyzer.py . --interactive
# Browse sorries, open in $EDITOR, navigate by file
```

**üîß Generate sorry reports:**
```bash
# Dispatch Explore agent to run:
scripts/sorry_analyzer.py src/ --format=markdown > SORRIES.md
```

### Phase 4: Managing Type Class Issues

**Sub-structures need explicit instances** (common with sub-œÉ-algebras, submeasures):

```lean
-- ‚ùå Common error: Lean can't synthesize instance
have h_le : m ‚â§ m0 := ...
-- Later: "Failed to synthesize MeasurableSpace Œ©"
--        "typeclass instance problem is stuck"

-- ‚úÖ Fix: Provide instance explicitly
haveI : MeasurableSpace Œ© := m0  -- Explicit instance
-- OR use Fact:
haveI : Fact (m ‚â§ m0) := ‚ü®h_le‚ü©
```

**CRITICAL - Binder order matters:** When working with sub-structures (like `m : MeasurableSpace Œ©` with ambient `[MeasurableSpace Œ©]`), the parameter `m` must come AFTER all instance parameters to avoid instance resolution choosing the wrong structure.

**When synthesis fails:** Add `haveI : Instance := ...`, use `letI` for let-bound, or `@lemma (inst := your_instance)`.

## Finding and Using Mathlib Lemmas

**Philosophy:** Search before prove. Mathlib has 100,000+ theorems.

**üöÄ BEST: Use MCP server tools (if available)**
```lean
-- Find theorems by semantic search
mcp__lean-lsp__lean_leansearch("continuous functions on compact spaces")

-- Find theorems by type pattern
mcp__lean-lsp__lean_loogle("(?a -> ?b) -> List ?a -> List ?b")

-- Search current workspace
mcp__lean-lsp__lean_local_search("continuous")
```

**‚ö° EFFICIENT: Dispatch Explore agent (Claude Code users)**
```
"Dispatch Explore agent to run scripts/smart_search.sh 'continuous compact' --source=all and report top 3 results"
```

**üîß MANUAL: Direct search (without MCP/Claude Code)**
```bash
scripts/smart_search.sh "continuous compact" --source=leansearch
scripts/search_mathlib.sh "continuous.*compact" name
```

**Workflow:**
1. Search using MCP tools (preferred) or scripts
2. Read candidate file
3. Import and verify: `#check Continuous.isCompact_preimage`

**For detailed search techniques, naming conventions, and import organization, see:** `references/mathlib-guide.md`

## Essential Tactics

**Simplification:**
```lean
simp only [lem1, lem2]  -- Explicit (preferred)
simpa using h           -- Simplify and close
```

**Case analysis:**
```lean
by_cases h : p          -- Split on decidable
rcases h with ‚ü®x, hx‚ü©   -- Destructure exists/and
```

**Rewriting:**
```lean
rw [lemma]              -- Left-to-right
rw [‚Üê lemma]            -- Right-to-left
```

**Apply:**
```lean
apply lemma             -- Apply, leave subgoals
exact expr              -- Close goal exactly
refine pattern ?_       -- Apply with holes
```

**Function equality:**
```lean
ext x / funext x        -- Prove functions equal pointwise
```

**For comprehensive tactics guide, simp deep dive, and automation, see:** `references/tactics-reference.md`

## Domain-Specific Patterns

**Analysis & Topology:**
- Integrability: bounded + measurable + finite = integrable
- Continuity from preimage
- Compactness via finite subcover
- Tactics: `continuity`, `fun_prop`

**Algebra:**
- Build instances compositionally: `instance : CommRing (Polynomial R) := inferInstance`
- Quotient constructions with `refine`
- Tactics: `ring`, `field_simp`, `group`

**Measure Theory & Probability:**
- Conditional expectation equality via uniqueness
- Type class instance management for sub-œÉ-algebras
- Almost everywhere properties: `ae_of_all`, `filter_upwards`
- Tactics: `measurability`, `positivity`

**For detailed patterns, real-world examples, and measure theory specifics, see:** `references/domain-patterns.md`

## Lean MCP Server Tools (Claude Code)

If using Claude Code with the Lean MCP server, powerful interactive tools are available:

**Essential tools:**
- `lean_goal` - Check proof state at cursor (USE OFTEN!)
- `lean_diagnostic_messages` - Get all compilation errors
- `lean_local_search` - Find project declarations (VERY FAST!)
- `lean_leansearch` - Search mathlib with natural language
- `lean_loogle` - Search by type signature

**Common workflow:**
1. `lean_goal` to see what needs proving
2. `lean_local_search` for project lemmas
3. `lean_leansearch`/`lean_loogle` for mathlib
4. Edit file with tactics
5. `lean_diagnostic_messages` to verify
6. Repeat

**For complete MCP tool reference, workflows, and troubleshooting, see:** `references/mcp-server.md`

## Managing Incomplete Proofs

### Standard vs Custom Axioms

**Standard mathlib axioms (acceptable):** `Classical.choice`, `propext`, `quot.sound`

Check with: `#print axioms my_theorem`

**Custom axioms need elimination plan:**
```lean
-- ‚ùå Bad: No plan
axiom my_conjecture : P

-- ‚úÖ Good: Documented strategy
axiom helper_theorem : P
-- TODO: Prove using technique X, need lemmas A, B from mathlib, ~2 days
```

### Sorry Documentation

**Every sorry needs:** What (goal), How (strategy), Dependencies (blockers)

```lean
have h : Complex_Goal := by
  sorry
  -- TODO: (1) Apply monotone convergence, (2) Show f_n ‚â§ f_{n+1},
  --       (3) Show bound. Need `tendsto_lintegral_of_monotone`, ~2h
```

### Elimination Pattern

```lean
-- 1. Start with axiom
axiom key_lemma : Goal  -- TODO: Replace with mathlib's result_X

-- 2. Find infrastructure
#check mathlib_result

-- 3. Replace with proof
theorem key_lemma : Goal := by exact mathlib_result ...
```

## Common Compilation Errors

Quick reference for the most common errors:

| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "failed to synthesize instance" | Add `haveI : IsProbabilityMeasure Œº := ‚ü®proof‚ü©` |
| "maximum recursion depth" | Provide manually: `letI := instance` or increase limit |
| "type mismatch" (has type ‚Ñï but expected ‚Ñù) | Use coercion: `(x : ‚Ñù)` or `‚Üëx` |
| "tactic 'exact' failed" | Use `apply` or restructure term |
| "unknown identifier 'ring'" | Add: `import Mathlib.Tactic.Ring` |

**For detailed error explanations, debugging, and solutions, see:** `references/compilation-errors.md`

## Leveraging Subagents for Automation

**When working in Claude Code**, delegate mechanical tasks to specialized subagents. This keeps the main conversation focused on proof strategy while automating search, analysis, and verification.

### When to Dispatch Subagents

**Dispatch subagents for:**
- **Search tasks** - Finding mathlib lemmas, instances, or similar proofs
- **Analysis tasks** - Complexity metrics, dependency graphs, sorry reports
- **Verification tasks** - Checking axioms across multiple files
- **Exploratory tasks** - Understanding codebase structure or unfamiliar patterns

**Keep in main conversation:**
- **Proof development** - Writing tactics and structuring arguments
- **Design decisions** - Choosing proof approaches or architectures
- **Error debugging** - Interpreting type checker feedback
- **Strategic planning** - Breaking down theorems into subgoals

### Agent Types for Lean 4 Work

**Explore agent** (fast, lightweight):
```
Use for: Quick searches, file discovery, pattern matching
Tools: Glob, Grep, Read, Bash
Cost: ~Haiku-level tokens
When: "Find all files using MeasurableSpace", "Locate definition of X"
```

**General-purpose agent** (thorough, multi-step):
```
Use for: Complex searches, analysis requiring judgment
Tools: Full toolset including Task
Cost: ~Sonnet-level tokens
When: Running scripts that need interpretation, comparing multiple approaches
```

### Automation Scripts + Subagents

**Pattern: Delegate script execution to Explore agents**

Instead of running scripts directly in main conversation, dispatch lightweight subagents:

```
‚úÖ Efficient:
"Dispatch Explore agent to run scripts/sorry_analyzer.py on src/ and report top 5 sorries to tackle"
"Dispatch Explore agent to find all MeasurableSpace instances using scripts/find_instances.sh"

‚ùå Inefficient:
[Running scripts/sorry_analyzer.py directly, consuming main conversation tokens]
```

### Example Workflows

**Finding mathlib lemmas:**
```
You: "I need lemmas about continuous functions on compact spaces"

Claude (in main conversation):
- Dispatches Explore agent: "Run scripts/smart_search.sh 'continuous compact' --source=leansearch and report top 3 results"
- Agent reports back with specific lemmas
- Main conversation continues with: "Let's use Continuous.image_of_compact..."
```

**Analyzing proof complexity:**
```
You: "Which proofs should I refactor first?"

Claude (in main conversation):
- Dispatches Explore agent: "Run scripts/proof_complexity.sh src/ --sort-by=lines and report top 10"
- Agent reports: "proof_main (245 lines), helper_convergence (180 lines), ..."
- Main conversation: "Let's refactor proof_main first - it has 3 natural subgoals we can extract"
```

**Checking axiom usage before commit:**
```
You: "Ready to commit - verify axioms"

Claude (in main conversation):
- Dispatches Explore agent: "Run scripts/check_axioms_inline.sh 'src/**/*.lean' and report any non-standard axioms"
- Agent reports: "‚úì All 150 declarations use only standard axioms"
- Main conversation: "Great! Let's commit."
```

**Interactive sorry selection:**
```
You: "What should I work on next?"

Claude (in main conversation):
- Suggests: "Let's use the interactive sorry navigator"
- You run: scripts/sorry_analyzer.py . --interactive
- You pick sorry #3 from the TUI
- Return to main conversation: "I'm working on the convergence proof in line 245"
```

### Subagent Dispatch Patterns

**Explicit delegation:**
```
"I'm going to dispatch an Explore agent to search mathlib for [X]"
[Uses Task tool with Explore agent]
[Agent reports back]
"The agent found [Y], let's use that..."
```

**Batch operations:**
```
"Dispatch Explore agent to:
1. Run sorry_analyzer.py on entire project
2. Run check_axioms_inline.sh on changed files
3. Report summary statistics"
```

**Iterative search:**
```
"Dispatch general-purpose agent to:
1. Search mathlib for continuous function lemmas
2. If found, check which apply to compact spaces
3. If none apply, search for compactness preservation
4. Report most relevant 3 lemmas with import paths"
```

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Main conversation tokens are expensive:**
- Reading 100-line script output: ~500 tokens (wasted on boilerplate)
- Explaining script results: ~200 tokens

**Subagent delegation is cheap:**
- Dispatch + receive summary: ~100 tokens
- Agent uses Haiku/fast model for execution
- **Savings: 600 tokens ‚Üí 100 tokens (6x reduction)**

**When NOT to use subagents:**
- Single-file searches (use Grep directly)
- Immediate tactical decisions (type checker feedback)
- Small proofs (<20 lines)
- Already have the information

## Quality Checklist

**Before commit:**
- [ ] File compiles: `lake env lean <file>`
- [ ] Full project builds: `lake build`
- [ ] All new `sorry`s documented with strategy
  - üöÄ MCP: Use `mcp__lean-lsp__lean_diagnostic_messages`
  - ‚ö° Script: Dispatch agent with `scripts/sorry_analyzer.py`
- [ ] No new axioms (or documented with elimination plan)
  - üöÄ Best: N/A (MCP doesn't have axiom checker)
  - ‚ö° Efficient: Dispatch agent with `scripts/check_axioms_inline.sh "src/**/*.lean"`
  - üîß Manual: Run `scripts/check_axioms_inline.sh` directly
- [ ] Imports minimal and specific

**Efficient workflow (Claude Code users):**
```
"Dispatch Explore agent to:
1. Run scripts/sorry_analyzer.py src/ and report count
2. Run scripts/check_axioms_inline.sh 'src/**/*.lean' and report any issues
3. Summarize: Ready to commit?"
```

**Doing it right ‚úÖ:**
- File always compiles after each change
- Each commit advances one specific lemma
- Helper lemmas accumulate and get reused
- Axioms decrease over time
- Proofs build on mathlib
- **Using MCP server or delegating to subagents for mechanical tasks**

**Red flags üö©:**
- Multiple compilation errors accumulating
- Sorries multiply faster than they're filled
- Fighting with type checker for hours
- Adding custom axioms without plan
- Reproving things mathlib has
- Proofs are monolithic (>100 lines with no structure)

**ALL red flags mean: Return to systematic approach.**
