# Lean 4 Theorem Proving - Claude Code Skill

A comprehensive [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skill for systematic development of formal proofs in Lean 4.

## üéØ What is This?

This is a **Claude Skill** that teaches Claude Code how to work effectively with Lean 4 theorem proving. It provides:

- üìö **Systematic workflow** for proof development (structure ‚Üí helpers ‚Üí incremental filling)
- üîß **Type class management** patterns for sub-œÉ-algebras and instance inference
- üìñ **Mathlib integration** guide (finding lemmas, imports, naming conventions)
- üéì **Domain-specific patterns** for measure theory, probability, and algebra
- ‚úÖ **Quality standards** (compile before commit, document sorries, eliminate axioms)
- üí° **Real-world examples** from successful Lean formalization projects

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

This skill requires the **[Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)** plugin for Claude Code. Superpowers is a skills library system created by Jesse Vincent that extends Claude Code with structured workflows and domain expertise.

**Install Superpowers first:**

1. Ensure you have **Claude Code 2.0.13 or later**
2. In Claude Code, run:
   ```
   /plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
   /plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
   ```

For more details, visit: https://github.com/obra/superpowers

### Installing This Skill

Once Superpowers is installed:

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cameronfreer/lean4-theorem-proving-skill.git
   cd lean4-theorem-proving-skill
   ```

2. **Copy to your Superpowers skills directory:**
   ```bash
   cp -r skills/formal-verification ~/.config/superpowers/skills/skills/
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   ls ~/.config/superpowers/skills/skills/formal-verification/lean4-theorem-proving/
   # Should show: SKILL.md
   ```

The skill is now available in all Claude Code sessions!

### Alternative: Use Skill Files Directly

If you want to use the skill content without Superpowers, you can reference the skill files directly in your prompts or project documentation:

1. Clone the repository
2. Reference the content in `skills/formal-verification/lean4-theorem-proving/SKILL.md`
3. Copy relevant sections into your project's `CLAUDE.md` or prompt Claude Code to read the file

This approach works but won't have automatic activation based on context.

## üìñ Usage

### Automatic (Proactive)

Claude Code will automatically invoke this skill when you:
- Work on `.lean` files
- Prove theorems
- Manage sorries or axioms
- Ask about Lean-specific concepts

### Explicit Invocation

You can explicitly request the skill:

```
Use the lean4-theorem-proving skill to help me structure this proof
```

Or in the context of formal verification:

```
Following the Lean 4 skill, how should I manage these type class instances?
```

### Query the Skill

Ask specific questions about the guidance:

```
What does the Lean 4 skill say about managing sorries?
What's the recommended workflow for eliminating axioms?
```

## üéì What the Skill Teaches

### Core Workflow

1. **Structure Before Solving** - Outline proof strategy before writing tactics
2. **Helper Lemmas First** - Build infrastructure bottom-up
3. **Incremental Filling** - One `sorry` at a time, compile, commit, repeat
4. **Type Class Management** - Explicit instance handling for sub-structures

### Key Principles

- ‚úÖ **Always compile before commit** (`lake build` is your test suite)
- ‚úÖ **Document every sorry** with strategy and dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Search mathlib first** before reproving standard results
- ‚úÖ **Eliminate axioms systematically** with documented plans
- ‚úÖ **One change at a time** - fill one sorry, compile, commit

### Common Patterns Included

- **Integrability proofs** (bounded + measurable + finite measure)
- **Conditional expectation equalities** (uniqueness via integral identity)
- **Sigma algebra manipulations** (sub-œÉ-algebra relationships)
- **Type class instance management** (explicit `haveI` declarations)

## ‚ùì FAQ

### What is Superpowers and do I need it?

**Superpowers** is a plugin for Claude Code created by Jesse Vincent that provides a skills system for teaching Claude structured workflows. This Lean 4 skill is packaged for Superpowers.

**Do you need it?**
- **Yes, for automatic activation** - The skill will automatically load when working on Lean files
- **No, for manual use** - You can copy the SKILL.md content into your project documentation or reference it directly

Install Superpowers: https://github.com/obra/superpowers

### Does this require Lean 4 to be installed?

No! The skill teaches Claude Code how to work with Lean 4, but Claude Code itself doesn't need Lean installed. If you're working on Lean projects, you'll obviously need Lean 4 installed locally.

### Will this work with Claude Code updates?

Yes! Skills are read from the filesystem and work with the standard Claude Code skills system.

### Can I modify the skill for my specific needs?

Absolutely! Clone this repo, modify `SKILL.md` to add your project-specific patterns, and use your customized version.

### Does this work for Lean 3?

This skill is specifically designed for Lean 4. Lean 3 has different syntax and tactics. You'd need to adapt it significantly for Lean 3.

### How is this different from Claude's general Lean knowledge?

Claude has general knowledge about Lean from training data. This skill provides:
- Specific workflows (structure before solve, one sorry at a time)
- Project-specific patterns (type class management, mathlib integration)
- Quality standards (compile before commit, document sorries)
- Real-world patterns from successful projects

It's like having a Lean 4 expert mentor coaching Claude on best practices.
