# Lean 4 Theorem Proving - Claude Skill

A comprehensive [Claude Skill](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills) for systematic development of formal proofs in Lean 4.

## üéØ What is This?

This is a **Claude Skill** that teaches Claude how to work effectively with Lean 4 theorem proving. Claude Skills are custom tools that provide specialized knowledge and workflows, available across Claude.ai, API, and Code.

**What this skill provides:**
- üìö **Systematic workflow** for proof development (structure ‚Üí helpers ‚Üí incremental filling)
- üîß **Type class management** patterns for sub-œÉ-algebras and instance inference
- üìñ **Mathlib integration** guide (finding lemmas, imports, naming conventions)
- üéì **Domain-specific patterns** for measure theory, probability, and algebra
- ‚úÖ **Quality standards** (compile before commit, document sorries, eliminate axioms)
- üí° **Real-world examples** from successful Lean formalization projects

## üöÄ Installation

### Method 1: Marketplace (Recommended for Claude Code)

Install directly from the marketplace using Claude Code's plugin system:

```
/plugin marketplace add cameronfreer/lean4-theorem-proving-skill
/plugin install lean4-theorem-proving
```

The skill will automatically load when Claude detects you're working on Lean files!

### Method 2: Manual Installation

Copy the skill to your local Claude skills directory:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cameronfreer/lean4-theorem-proving-skill.git
cd lean4-theorem-proving-skill

# Copy to Claude skills directory
cp -r lean4-theorem-proving ~/.claude/skills/

# Verify installation
ls ~/.claude/skills/lean4-theorem-proving/
# Should show: SKILL.md
```

The skill is now available in all Claude sessions (Claude.ai, API, and Code)!

### Method 3: Project-Specific (CLAUDE.md)

For project-specific use without installation:

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy relevant sections from `lean4-theorem-proving/SKILL.md` into your project's `CLAUDE.md`
3. Or reference the skill file directly in your prompts

## üìñ Usage

### Automatic Activation

Claude automatically loads this skill when you:
- Work on `.lean` files
- Mention Lean 4, theorem proving, or formal verification
- Prove theorems or manage sorries/axioms
- Ask about mathlib or type class issues

No manual invocation needed - Claude sees the skill in its chain of thought!

### Explicit Invocation

You can explicitly request the skill if desired:

```
Use the lean4-theorem-proving skill to help me structure this proof
```

### Query the Skill

Ask about specific guidance:

```
What does the Lean 4 skill recommend for managing sorries?
How should I handle type class inference issues?
```

## üéì What the Skill Teaches

### Core Workflow

1. **Structure Before Solving** - Outline proof strategy before writing tactics
2. **Helper Lemmas First** - Build infrastructure bottom-up
3. **Incremental Filling** - One `sorry` at a time, compile, commit, repeat
4. **Type Class Management** - Explicit instance handling for sub-structures

### Key Principles

- ‚úÖ **Always compile before commit** (`lake build` is your test suite)
- ‚úÖ **Document every sorry** with strategy and dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Search mathlib first** before reproving standard results
- ‚úÖ **Eliminate axioms systematically** with documented plans
- ‚úÖ **One change at a time** - fill one sorry, compile, commit

### Common Patterns Included

- **Integrability proofs** (bounded + measurable + finite measure)
- **Conditional expectation equalities** (uniqueness via integral identity)
- **Sigma algebra manipulations** (sub-œÉ-algebra relationships)
- **Type class instance management** (explicit `haveI` declarations)
- **Commit message patterns** from successful Lean projects

## ‚ùì FAQ

### What are Claude Skills?

Claude Skills are custom tools announced by Anthropic in October 2025 that teach Claude specialized tasks. Skills are folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude loads dynamically when relevant. They work across Claude.ai, API, and Code.

Learn more: https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills

### Do I need a subscription?

- **Claude Code (marketplace)**: Available to all Claude Code users
- **Manual installation (~/.claude/skills)**: Available to all users
- **Claude.ai/API**: Skills feature requires Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise

### Does this require Lean 4?

No! The skill teaches Claude how to work with Lean 4. You only need Lean 4 installed if you're actually working on Lean projects locally.

### How is this different from Claude's general Lean knowledge?

Claude has general knowledge about Lean from training data. This skill provides:
- **Specific workflows** (structure before solve, one sorry at a time)
- **Project patterns** (type class management, mathlib integration)
- **Quality standards** (compile before commit, document sorries)
- **Real-world patterns** from successful projects

It's like having a Lean 4 expert mentor coaching Claude on best practices.

### Can I modify the skill?

Absolutely! Clone this repo, modify `lean4-theorem-proving/SKILL.md` to add your project-specific patterns, and either:
- Use your fork as a custom marketplace
- Install locally from your modified version
- Add custom content to your project's CLAUDE.md

### Does this work with Superpowers?

While this is now packaged as an official Claude Skill, you can still use it with Superpowers by copying the skill folder to `~/.config/superpowers/skills/skills/`. However, we recommend using the official Claude Skills installation for better integration.
