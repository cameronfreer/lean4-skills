# Skill Analysis: lean4-theorem-proving

Analysis conducted using:
- **Anthropic skill-creator** (official guidance)
- **Superpowers writing-skills** (TDD for documentation)

## Executive Summary

**Overall Quality: 8.5/10**

The skill is well-structured and follows progressive disclosure principles effectively. Minor improvements needed for Anthropic compliance and optimization.

## Strengths ‚úÖ

### 1. Progressive Disclosure (Excellent)
- **SKILL.md**: 1,414 words (optimal range)
- **References**: 9,035 words across 5 files
- **Total**: ~10,400 words with proper separation
- References loaded on-demand, keeping core skill lean

### 2. Directory Structure (Compliant)
```
lean4-theorem-proving/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md ‚úÖ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ references/ ‚úÖ
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compilation-errors.md (1,074 words)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain-patterns.md (1,962 words)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mathlib-guide.md (1,728 words)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp-server.md (2,546 words)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tactics-reference.md (1,725 words)
```
- Proper separation of core workflow (SKILL.md) from detailed references
- No unnecessary `scripts/` or `assets/` directories

### 3. Content Organization (Strong)
- Clear "What, When, How" structure
- Concrete examples with code
- Domain-specific patterns
- Quality checklist and red flags
- References clearly signposted

### 4. Empirical Validation (Unique)
- TESTING.md documents real-world usage
- Baseline behaviors from 1000+ commits
- Measurable improvements documented
- Grounded in actual formalization work

### 5. Token Efficiency (Good)
- Core SKILL.md under 1,500 words
- References separate and loadable on-demand
- No redundant multi-language examples

## Issues Found üî¥

### Critical (Anthropic Compliance)

#### 1. Frontmatter Description Style Violation
**Current:**
```yaml
description: Use when writing Lean 4 proofs, managing sorries/axioms...
```

**Issue:** Second-person imperative ("Use when...")

**Required:** Third-person per Anthropic skill-creator:
> "Use the third-person (e.g. 'This skill should be used when...' instead of 'Use this skill when...')."

**Fix:**
```yaml
description: This skill should be used when writing Lean 4 proofs, managing sorries/axioms, facing "failed to synthesize instance" or type class errors, or searching mathlib - provides systematic build-first workflow, type class management patterns (haveI/letI), and domain-specific tactics for measure theory, probability, and algebra
```

#### 2. Body Writing Style (Minor)
**Location:** Line 16
**Current:** "Use for ANY Lean 4 development..."
**Issue:** Second-person imperative

**Required:** Imperative/infinitive form per Anthropic:
> "Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person."

**Fix:** "This skill applies to ANY Lean 4 development..." or "Apply this skill for ANY Lean 4 development..."

### Minor Improvements

#### 3. Description Could Be More Concise
Current description is 202 characters, which is good but could be tightened:

**Option A (More concise):**
```yaml
description: This skill should be used when developing Lean 4 proofs - handles type class synthesis errors, sorry/axiom management, mathlib search, and provides build-first workflows for measure theory, probability, and algebra
```

**Option B (Symptom-focused for better triggering):**
```yaml
description: This skill should be used when seeing "failed to synthesize instance", managing sorries/axioms in Lean 4, searching mathlib, or working with measure theory - provides systematic build-first workflow and type class management patterns
```

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Anthropic Compliance (Required for Marketplace)

1. **Fix frontmatter description** (5 minutes)
   - Change from second-person to third-person
   - Apply one of the suggested alternatives above

2. **Fix line 16 writing style** (2 minutes)
   - Change "Use for ANY..." to imperative/infinitive form
   - Scan for any other second-person instances

### Priority 2: Enhancement (Optional)

3. **Consider adding scripts/** (if useful)
   - Could include helper scripts for:
     - `scripts/search_mathlib.sh` - Automated mathlib searching
     - `scripts/check_axioms.sh` - Batch axiom checking
     - `scripts/sorry_analyzer.py` - Extract all sorries with context

4. **Consider formal subagent testing** (following Superpowers TDD)
   - Create pressure scenarios
   - Test baseline behavior without skill
   - Verify skill prevents rationalizations
   - Document findings in TESTING.md

5. **Package validation** (when ready)
   - Run Anthropic's package_skill.py script
   - Fix any validation errors
   - Generate distributable .zip

## Token Budget Analysis

**Metadata (always loaded):** ~50 words
**SKILL.md (when triggered):** 1,414 words
**References (as needed):** 1,000-2,500 words each

**Total context impact:** Excellent - progressive disclosure working as intended

## Comparison to Similar Skills

Comparing to Anthropic example skills:
- **Similar structure to:** MCP-builder (SKILL.md + references)
- **Better than:** Skills with monolithic SKILL.md
- **Room for improvement:** Could add executable scripts like PDF skill

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Complete analysis (DONE)
2. üîß Apply Priority 1 fixes (frontmatter + line 16)
3. üì¶ Run package_skill.py validation
4. üß™ (Optional) Conduct formal subagent testing
5. ‚ú® (Optional) Add scripts/ for automation
6. üöÄ Package for distribution

## Summary Assessment

**This is a high-quality skill that is 95% compliant with Anthropic standards.**

The main blocker for marketplace submission is the frontmatter description style. Fix that one line, and it's ready for packaging and validation.

The empirical testing approach (vs. formal TDD) is acceptable given the real-world validation from 1000+ commits. The skill demonstrates proven effectiveness rather than hypothetical scenarios.

**Recommendation: Fix Priority 1 items, then package and ship.**
