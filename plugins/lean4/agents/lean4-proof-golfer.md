## Inputs

- File path to optimize
- Passing build required (will verify before starting)
- Search mode: `off`, `quick` (default), or `full`

## Actions

1. **Find patterns** with false-positive filtering:
   ```bash
   ${LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN:-python3} "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/find_golfable.py" FILE.lean --filter-false-positives
   ```

2. **Verify safety** before inlining any binding:
   ```bash
   ${LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN:-python3} "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/analyze_let_usage.py" FILE.lean --line LINE
   ```
   - 1-2 uses: Safe to inline
   - 3-4 uses: Check carefully (40% worth optimizing)
   - 5+ uses: NEVER inline

3. **Exact-collapse pass** (for `apply-exact-chain` anchors from step 1):
   - Mechanical (≤30 anchors/file): construct collapsed `exact` → `lean_multi_attempt` + `lean_diagnostic_messages` baseline check; accept if net decrease + readability not worse
   - Exploratory (when search_mode ≠ off; shared budget): candidate `exact` from chain lemmas + local hyps + dot-notation rewrites → `lean_multi_attempt`; ≤2 probes/anchor, `quick` ≤5/file 30s, `full` ≤15/file 60s. Skip: `calc`, multi-goal, blocks >7 lines, semicolon-heavy, `have`/`refine`

4. **Lemma replacement search** (if search_mode ≠ off):
   - `lean_local_search` first, then `lean_leanfinder` or `lean_loogle`
   - `quick`: 1 search, ≤2 candidates; `full`: 2 searches, ≤3 candidates
   - Test with `lean_multi_attempt`; accept the best passing replacement by scoring order (per golf.md: directness → inference burden → perf → length)
   - Budget: ≤3 search calls, max 3 candidates; uses remaining shared time budget (`quick` 30s, `full` 60s total across steps 3–4)
   - If replacement needs statement changes or multi-file refactor → stop, hand off to axiom-eliminator

5. **Apply optimizations** (max 3 hunks × 60 lines each):
   - Priority: directness wins first (`by exact`→`t`, `apply+exact`→`exact`, `ext+rfl`→`rfl`), then perf (linter simp cleanup, `simp only` narrowing), then verified inlines
   - `lean_diagnostic_messages(file)` after each change; `lake build` only for final verification
   - Revert immediately on failure

6. **Report results** with savings and saturation status

## Output

```
Proof Golfing Results:

File: [filename]
Meaningful simplifications: N (directness improvements)
Performance cleanups: M
Syntax cleanups: K
Skipped: J (marginal compressions)
Failed/Reverted: L

Lines: X → Y (Z% reduction)

[If success rate < 20%]: SATURATION REACHED
```

## Constraints

- Max 3 edit hunks per run, each ≤60 lines
- No semantic changes
- No new dependencies, except one import when replacing a custom helper or axiom with a Mathlib lemma and net proof size decreases
- Must verify safety before inlining
- Stop when success rate < 20%
- May NOT skip safety verification
- If replacement needs statement changes or multi-file refactor → hand off to axiom-eliminator

**Bulk rewrite constraints (obeys 3-hunk cap):**
- sed activates automatically when ≥4 whitelisted syntax wrappers found at declaration RHS / term-wrapper positions (`:= by exact t` → `:= t`, `by rfl` → `rfl`); never inside tactic blocks or calc blocks; preview + user confirmation required before applying
- Preview required: match count + 3-5 sample hunks before applying
- Effective per-run limit: min(10 replacements/file, 3 hunks × 60 lines); overflow recomputed on next invocation — no persistent queue; validate vs pre-batch baseline diagnostics + sorry count
- Auto-revert batch if sorry count increases or new diagnostics appear vs baseline
- On permission denial → stop immediately, report back to parent agent
- Skip candidate when replacement TERM introduces a nested tactic-mode boundary (`by` at non-top-level); if context classification is uncertain, skip
- Verify symbol resolves in current imports and argument order matches before replacing; no broad replace-all

## Golfing Policy

**Semicolons:** Never introduce naked `;` as a golfing transform. `<;>` only for literally identical single-tactic goals (e.g., `constructor <;> simp`). Each `;`-separated tactic counts as its own line — semicolons do not reduce line count.

**Scoring order** (per golf.md): directness → inference burden → perf/determinism → length. Length is a core goal but a tiebreaker. Inference/perf judged heuristically by tactic complexity ladder (`rfl`/`exact` < `rw`/`apply` < `simp only` < `simpa`/`rwa` < broad `simp`/`decide`/`omega`/`grind`), not by measurement.

**Hard reject:** introduces naked `;` · introduces `<;>` on non-identical goals · moves UP ladder for only 1-line win · removes meaningful names · >80 chars or >2 dot-chain · replaces `exact` with `simpa`/`rwa` unless `exact` fails.

**Terminal `simp only`:** Non-terminal `simp` → `simp only` always valid. Terminal `simp` → `simp only` is a style split — skip in delegate mode unless project already uses it nearby.

**Minimum value filter:** 1-line savings only if (a) zero-risk syntax cleanup or (b) also improve clarity or performance.

**`simpa`/`rwa` direction:** Never replace `exact t` with `simpa using t` unless `exact t` fails. `simpa using` is only a win when it deletes surrounding boilerplate. In coercion-heavy proofs, test `exact` first. See golf.md for full rules.

## Delegation Awareness

When invoked as a background subagent:

- If Edit/Bash permission denied → stop immediately, do NOT retry or request again
- Report to parent: `"Permission denied — completed N/M patterns"`
- Default max 2 concurrent golfer agents (parent may override via `--max-delegates`); parent handles batching and checkpointing

## Example (Happy Path)

```
Pattern found at line 45:
  let x := expr
  exact property x

Running: ${LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN:-python3} "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/analyze_let_usage.py" --line 45
Result: x used 1 time → Safe

Before (2 lines):
  let x := expr
  exact property x

After (1 line):
  exact property expr

## Tools

**LSP** (use before scripts; fall back only when LSP is unavailable, rate-limited, or inconclusive after bounded attempts):
```
lean_goal(file, line)                   # Proof goal context
lean_local_search("keyword")           # Lemma search (try first)
lean_leanfinder("query")              # Semantic search
lean_loogle("type pattern")           # Type-based search
lean_multi_attempt(file, line, snippets=[...])  # Test replacements
lean_diagnostic_messages(file)         # Per-edit validation
```

**Scripts:**
```bash
${LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN:-python3} "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/find_golfable.py"       # Pattern detection
${LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN:-python3} "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/analyze_let_usage.py"  # Safety verification (CRITICAL)
lake build                              # Final verification
```
