"""
Try automated solvers in sequence before resampling with LLM.
Handles 40-60% of simple cases mechanically.

Cascade order:
1. rfl (definitional equality)
2. simp (simplifier)
3. ring (ring normalization)
4. linarith (linear arithmetic)
5. nlinarith (nonlinear arithmetic)
6. omega (arithmetic automation)
7. exact? (proof search)
8. apply? (proof search)
9. aesop (general automation)

Returns diff if any solver succeeds.

Inspired by APOLLO's solver-first strategy
