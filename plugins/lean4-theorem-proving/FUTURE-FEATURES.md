```lean
theorem big_result : ComplexProperty := by
  sketch
    "First establish auxiliary property P1 using lemma_a and continuity"
    "Then derive P2 from P1 combined with lemma_b"
    "Show P3 follows by induction on the structure"
    "Finally combine P1, P2, P3 via theorem_c to get the result"

  Interactive: asks user for each step description
  Generates scaffolding incrementally
```

**Priority:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Novel, bridges informal/formal beautifully)

---

### 8. Collaborative Multi-Agent Proof Sessions

**What:** Dispatch multiple agents to work on independent subgoals in parallel, then merge results.

**Use case:**
```
You have 5 independent sorries in different theorems:
  - theorem_a (sorry at line 42) - type: algebra
  - theorem_b (sorry at line 58) - type: continuity
  - theorem_c (sorry at line 91) - type: measurability
  - theorem_d (sorry at line 103) - type: equality
  - theorem_e (sorry at line 127) - type: induction

Dispatching 5 lean4-sorry-filler agents in parallel...
Agent 1: ‚úì Filled theorem_a using ring
Agent 2: ‚úì Filled theorem_b using continuous_of_compose
Agent 3: ‚úó Failed theorem_c (escalating to deep)
Agent 4: ‚úì Filled theorem_d using rfl
Agent 5: ‚úì Filled theorem_e using Nat.rec

Merging results... Done.
4/5 filled. 1 requires deep pass.
```

**Implementation sketch:**
```markdown
Enhancement to /lean4-theorem-proving:fill-sorry:

  New flag: --parallel

  Workflow:
  1. Analyze file: find all sorries
  2. Check independence:
     - Do theorems depend on each other?
     - Build dependency graph
     - Identify independent clusters
  3. Dispatch agents in parallel (one per sorry)
  4. Collect results as they complete
  5. Merge non-conflicting edits
  6. If conflicts: prioritize by success rate
  7. Report summary

Conflict resolution:
  - If two agents edit same theorem: pick successful one
  - If both succeed: pick shorter proof
  - If both fail: escalate to deep pass

Track effectiveness:
  - Which agent types work best for which goal types
  - Learn from success patterns
```

**Priority:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Significant speedup for batch work)

## üìä Analytics and Learning

### 10. Proof Pattern Mining Across Projects

**What:** Analyze multiple Lean codebases to discover universal proof patterns and underutilized lemmas.

**Data sources:**
- mathlib itself (canonical patterns)
- User's projects (project-specific idioms)
- Public Lean repositories (emerging techniques)

**Outputs:**
- "95% of `Continuous` proofs in mathlib use this 3-step pattern"
- "These 10 powerful lemmas are underutilized (appeared <5 times in 1000+ opportunities)"
- "Pattern X is emerging in recent commits (appeared 15 times in last month)"

**Implementation sketch:**
```markdown
New tool: scripts/mine_proof_patterns.py

Input: List of git repositories
Config: .proof-mining.toml
  [sources]
  mathlib = "~/mathlib4"
  project = "."
  examples = ["~/lean-projects/example1", "~/lean-projects/example2"]

  [analysis]
  min_occurrences = 3
  min_repos = 2

Workflow:
1. Clone/pull all source repos
2. Parse all .lean files in each
3. Extract proof structure:
   - Goal type ‚Üí tactic sequence
   - Lemmas used ‚Üí context where used
   - Common compositions (lemma chains)
4. Build pattern database:
   ```json
   {
     "pattern_id": "continuous_compose_pattern_1",
     "goal_type": "Continuous (f ‚àò g)",
     "tactic_sequence": ["apply Continuous.comp", "exact hf", "exact hg"],
     "occurrences": 247,
     "repos": ["mathlib", "project_x", "project_y"],
     "success_rate": 0.98,
     "avg_proof_length": 3
   }
   ```
5. Generate reports:
   - Top 50 patterns by frequency
   - Underutilized powerful lemmas
   - Emerging patterns (trending up)

Output: references/mined-patterns.md (auto-generated reference)

Integration: fill-sorry reads mined-patterns.md for suggestions

New slash command: /lean4-theorem-proving:mine-patterns [--update]
```

**Priority:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Genuinely novel, could discover hidden gems)

### 11. Interactive Proof Tutor

**What:** Socratic agent that teaches proof techniques through interactive dialogue.

**Example session:**
```
User: /lean4-theorem-proving:tutor-mode

Tutor: Welcome! I'll help you learn Lean proof techniques.
       Let's start with a simple goal. What are you trying to prove?

User: theorem example : ‚àÄ n : ‚Ñï, n + 0 = n

Tutor: Great! Let's break this down. What type of statement is this?
       (Hint: Look at the outermost structure)

User: It's a for-all statement?

Tutor: Exactly right! When you see `‚àÄ x, P x`, what's typically the first
       tactic you use?

User: intro?

Tutor: Perfect! Try adding `intro n` and tell me what goal remains.

User: It becomes `n + 0 = n`

Tutor: Good. Now we have an equality goal. Lean has powerful automation
       for natural number arithmetic. Do you know a tactic that can
       handle simple arithmetic equations?

User: simp?

Tutor: That would work! But there's an even more direct tactic for
       definitional equalities. Try typing `rfl` and see what happens.

User: It worked!

Tutor: Excellent! You just learned that `n + 0 = n` is true by definition
       in Lean. The key insight: always try `rfl` for equations that
       "should be obviously true".

       Ready for a slightly harder example?
```

**Implementation sketch:**
```markdown
New subagent: plugins/lean4-subagents/agents/lean4-proof-tutor.md
- Tools: Read, Grep, WebFetch, mcp__lean-lsp__* (for live goals)
- Model: sonnet-4.5 (requires pedagogical skill)
- Thinking: on (needs to plan teaching strategy)

New reference: references/teaching-strategies.md
  - Socratic method principles
  - Common beginner mistakes and how to address
  - Progression of difficulty levels
  - When to give hints vs full answers

Curriculum structure:
  Level 1: Basic tactics (intro, exact, rfl, apply)
  Level 2: Equality reasoning (rw, simp, ring)
  Level 3: Case analysis (cases, induction, by_cases)
  Level 4: Advanced tactics (conv, calc, have chains)
  Level 5: Domain-specific automation

State tracking:
  - Which tactics student has mastered
  - Which patterns still cause confusion
  - Difficulty level
  - Progress through curriculum

New slash command: /lean4-theorem-proving:tutor-mode [--level=beginner|intermediate|advanced]

Integration with memory MCP:
  - Store student progress across sessions
  - "Welcome back! Last time we worked on induction. Ready to practice more?"
```

**Priority:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Huge value for learning, novel application)

**Visual features:**
- Tree structure showing tactic branching
- Color coding:
  - Green: automation (simp, ring, etc.)
  - Blue: mathlib lemmas
  - Yellow: custom lemmas
  - Red: sorries
- Size of nodes: complexity/time
- Annotations: intermediate goals at each node

**Example:**
```
theorem_main
‚îú‚îÄ intro x
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ cases x
‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ case zero: [simp] ‚úì
‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ case succ:
‚îÇ  ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ have h1: [custom_lemma] ‚úì
‚îÇ  ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ rw [h1]; [ring] ‚úì
‚îî‚îÄ done
```

**Implementation sketch:**
```markdown
New script: scripts/visualize_proof_tree.py FILE.lean THEOREM_NAME

Dependencies:
  - graphviz (for layout)
  - pygments (for syntax highlighting)
  - lean-lsp-client (for goal extraction)

Workflow:
1. Parse proof tactic block
2. Build tree structure:
   - Each tactic = node
   - Branching tactics (cases, induction) = multiple children
   - Terminal nodes = complete goals
3. Annotate nodes:
   - Extract intermediate goal at each step (via LSP)
   - Classify tactic type (automation/lemma/manual)
   - Measure complexity (proof state size)
4. Generate output:

   SVG mode:
     graphviz with custom styling

   Interactive HTML mode:
     D3.js tree layout
     Click node ‚Üí show full goal state
     Hover ‚Üí show tactic documentation

   PDF mode:
     LaTeX/TikZ for publication quality

## üöÄ Meta-Level Tools

### 13. Proof Performance Profiler

**What:** Beyond compilation time - analyze runtime characteristics and suggest optimizations.

**Metrics:**
- Tactic execution time (which tactics are slow?)
- Memory usage (large proof states)
- Kernel checks (expensive verification)
- Type class synthesis time
- Automation overhead (`decide`, `norm_num`, heavy `simp`)

**Suggestions:**
- "This `decide` proof takes 5s - consider using `native_decide` or manual proof"
- "Heavy `simp` at line 42 with 150 lemmas - narrow scope or use explicit lemmas"
- "Type class search timeout - add instance hints with `haveI`"

**Implementation sketch:**
```markdown
Enhancement to build-lean with --profile flag

New script: scripts/profile_proofs.sh FILE.lean

Workflow:
1. Run lake build with profiler:
   lake build --profile 2>&1 | tee profile.log

2. Parse profiler output:
   Extract timing data for each declaration

3. Identify hotspots:
   - Tactics taking >1s
   - Type class synthesis failures/retries
   - Large proof states (>10k tokens)

4. Analyze slow tactics:
   For each slow step:
   - What tactic was used?
   - How many simp lemmas active?
   - What's the proof state size?
   - Can it be optimized?

5. Generate report:

   ‚ö° Performance Profile for MyProof.lean

   Total compile: 12.3s

   üî• Hotspots:

   1. Line 42: `decide` (5.2s)
      Problem: Evaluating large decision procedure
      Suggestion: Use `native_decide` or prove manually

   2. Line 58: `simp [*]` (3.1s)
      Problem: 243 active simp lemmas, large context
      Suggestion: Narrow to `simp [lemma1, lemma2, lemma3]`

   3. Line 91: Type class synthesis (2.8s)
      Problem: Searching for `MeasurableSpace (Œ± ‚Üí Œ≤)`
      Suggestion: Add `haveI : MeasurableSpace (Œ± ‚Üí Œ≤) := ...`

   üí° Optimization potential: ~8s (65% reduction)

New slash command: /lean4-theorem-proving:profile-performance FILE.lean
```

**Priority:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Slow builds are frustrating)

**Features:**
- Detect potentially mathlib-worthy theorems
- Check if similar theorem already exists
- Format to mathlib style standards
- Generate proper documentation
- Run mathlib CI checks locally
- Create PR with all requirements

**Implementation sketch:**
```markdown
New subagent: plugins/lean4-subagents/agents/lean4-mathlib-contributor.md
- Tools: Bash, Read, Edit, Grep, WebFetch
- Model: sonnet-4.5 (strategic process)
- Thinking: on

New reference: references/mathlib-contribution-guide.md
  - Naming conventions
  - Documentation requirements (every def, every theorem ‚â•10 lines)
  - Import organization
  - PR process
  - Common review feedback

Workflow:
1. Analyze theorem for mathlib-worthiness:
   Criteria:
   - General enough (not too specific to one project)
   - Non-trivial (not immediate from existing lemmas)
   - Well-named (follows mathlib conventions)
   - Properly documented
   - In appropriate namespace

2. Search mathlib for duplicates:
   Use smart_search, leansearch, Loogle
   "Is this already in mathlib under a different name?"

3. Format to mathlib standards:
   - Check naming: snake_case, descriptive
   - Add docstring if missing
   - Organize imports (minimal, alphabetical)
   - Run mathlib linters locally

4. Prepare PR:
   - Create branch: mathlib-contrib/theorem_name
   - Copy theorem to appropriate mathlib file
   - Generate commit message (mathlib style)
   - Run CI locally: lake build, lake test
   - Create PR description

5. Pre-submission checklist:
   ‚úì Follows naming conventions
   ‚úì Has complete documentation
   ‚úì No duplicate in mathlib
   ‚úì Passes local CI
   ‚úì Minimal imports
   ‚úì Proper namespace
   ‚úì Tests added (if applicable)

New slash command: /lean4-theorem-proving:prepare-mathlib-pr THEOREM_NAME

Interactive prompts:
  - Which mathlib file should this go in?
  - What's the high-level description for the PR?
  - Are there related theorems to mention?
```

**Priority:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Encourages contribution, reduces friction)

---

### 15. Proof Diff Tool

**What:** Compare two proofs of the same theorem to identify best approach or hybrid strategies.

**Use cases:**
- "I proved this two ways - which is better?"
- "Someone else proved the same thing - what's different?"
- "Can I combine the best parts of both proofs?"

**Metrics:**
- Length (lines, characters)
- Readability (variable names, structure)
- Performance (compile time)
- Dependency count (mathlib lemmas used)
- Automation level (% tactic vs manual)

**Implementation sketch:**

New script: `scripts/proof_diff.py PROOF1.lean PROOF2.lean THEOREM_NAME`

**Workflow:**
1. Extract both proofs for the same theorem
2. Parse structure of each
3. Compare metrics:

   üìä Proof Comparison: theorem_example

   |                | Proof A (intro-based) | Proof B (direct)  | Winner |
   |----------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------|
   | Length         | 12 lines             | 5 lines           | B ‚úì    |
   | Readability    | 8/10                 | 6/10              | A ‚úì    |
   | Compile time   | 0.3s                 | 0.1s              | B ‚úì    |
   | Mathlib lemmas | 5                    | 2                 | B ‚úì    |
   | Automation     | 40%                  | 80%               | B ‚úì    |

   **Overall:** Proof B is shorter and faster
   **But:** Proof A is more readable and educational

   **Common structure:**
   - Both use continuous_of_compose
   - Both establish measurability first

   **Unique to A:**
   - Explicit have statements (clearer logic flow)
   - Named intermediate results

   **Unique to B:**
   - Uses refine for direct construction
   - More automation with simp

   **Recommended hybrid:**

## üìù Notes on Implementation

**General principles:**
- Start with standalone scripts (Python/Bash) before subagents
- Use existing infrastructure (bootstrap hooks, LSP, search tools)
- Build reference docs first, then agents that use them
- Incremental rollout: prototype ‚Üí test ‚Üí refine ‚Üí integrate

**Resource requirements:**
- Tier 1 features: Primarily tooling, minimal model cost
- Tier 2 features: More model usage, still reasonable
- Tier 3 features: Heavier model usage or complex infrastructure
- Research ideas: Experimental, may need external resources

**Maintenance considerations:**
- Features that depend on mathlib structure need update monitoring
- LSP integrations need versioning awareness
- Generated docs need clear "auto-generated" markers
- Learned patterns need periodic refresh
